- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

**Hugo Static Site**: All paths relative to repository root
- Theme files: `themes/sarcastic/`
- Content files: `content/`
- Config: `hugo.toml`

## Testing Approach

Since automated tests are not included, use this manual testing workflow:

### Per User Story Testing

**After each user story phase**:
1. Verify acceptance criteria from spec.md
2. Test independent test scenario
3. Check responsive behavior (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px+)
4. Validate Bulgarian content present and satirical

### Final Testing (Phase 8)

1. **Lighthouse**: Run audit, verify 90+ scores
2. **Core Web Vitals**: Check LCP, FID, CLS in "Good" range
3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader test, keyboard navigation, contrast check
4. **Cross-browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
5. **Mobile devices**: Real device testing (iOS + Android)
6. **SEO validators**: Facebook debugger, Google Rich Results Test, W3C HTML validator

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Build for production
hugo --minify

# Serve locally
cd public && python3 -m http.server 8000

# Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools (Incognito mode)
# Target scores: All 90+
```
